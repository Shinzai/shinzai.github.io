                    <p class="font">In the past 5 years I’ve mostly been working on social and personal skills with the help of the previous educations and internships. Because I’m kind of an introvert, and I’m more of a listener instead of chatting myself. </p>

                    <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
                    <p class="font">At first, I was an athletic person. I joined the “Sport Class”, in order to practice all kinds of sports like baseball, basketball, soccer, badminton, et cetera. Couple years went by and the doctors found out that I my heart valve only has 2 pieces. This means that my heart has to work differently to pump blood through my body. So my future of becoming an athletic derailed. I resorted back to my secondary hobby; computers. I decided to prepare myself for the future and started out at the beginning of Computer Science; learning the hardware, software and helping users to solve problems. Ever since, I kept progressing and decided to switch over to building my own applications, which gave me more freedom.</p>

                        I’m currently aiming to get my bachelor degree at the Hogeschool Rotterdam. My goal is to become more active in programming and creating “new” stuff. I’m also still working on my social and personal skills, to make myself fit in the community. 
                            My current goal is to be able to code within Java naturally. <br>
                            I've made my goal SMART, in order to achieve it.

                        Looking back at this year, I can say that I am proud of myself. I have learned a lot of things, even my social and personal skills have grown. 
                        If I would keep up this pace, I should be able to achieve my goal and get my bachelor degree. Things like making a persona, interviews, 
                        scrum were helpful as well, because these things help you to create a product that others desire. Things like brainstorming, shows different ways
                        of getting your info. Same goes for doing tests with the target audience. 
                        Even putting code from different project members was really hard at first. But once you start working with it, it becomes a piece of cake. Bugfixing 
                        was fun as well, because there were many small bugs that made us look for hours.
